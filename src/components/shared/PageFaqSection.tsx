      },
      {
        question: "Do the voice and chat tools work together?",
        answer: "That is the point of the platform direction. The same lead context, booking logic, and follow-up actions can carry across channels instead of living in silos.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is this designed for premium real estate brands?",

      },
      {
        question: "Is oyik a software tool or a service layer?",

      {
        question: "What makes the approach different from generic AI tools?",

      {
        question: "Can blog readers book a demo directly?",

      },
      {
        question: "Can the demo be tailored for my agency?",

      },
      {
        question: "Can humans still step in quickly?",

      },
      {
        question: "Which service usually delivers value first?",
        answer: "That depends on your bottleneck, but chat and voice usually stand out because they affect speed-to-lead immediately.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can services share one operating layer?",
        answer: "Yes. The strongest product story is that these services work as one connected AI desk instead of isolated tools.",

        answer: "The voice positioning covers sales, lettings, viewing coordination, landlord updates, and maintenance triage.",

        question: "Can calls trigger booking and CRM actions?",

        question: "Does the chatbot only answer FAQs?",
        answer: "No. It is positioned as a lead qualification and booking layer, not just a static support widget.",

        question: "Can the chat hand over to staff when intent is high?",
        answer: "Yes. Clean handoff with context is one of the strongest parts of the overall experience.",

        question: "Will reminders feel robotic?",
        answer: "They should not. The brand tone should stay polished and consistent with the rest of the premium client journey.",

        question: "Can reminders reduce no-shows?",
        answer: "That is exactly the value story: fewer missed appointments and less manual chasing.",

    title: "Contextual answers for the email automation page.",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Does email automation replace the team?",
        answer: "No. It is meant to accelerate replies, drafts, and follow-up so staff spend less time on repetitive inbox work.",
      },
      {
        question: "What kinds of messages can be handled?",
        answer: "Enquiries, booking details, document requests, and routine follow-ups are all part of the fit.",

        question: "Can email stay aligned with property context?",

    title: "Questions tied to the maintenance intake workflow.",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Can maintenance requests be triaged automatically?",

        question: "Does it help reduce back-and-forth?",
        answer: "That is one of the main reasons to use it, especially when teams lose time chasing missing details.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can urgent issues be escalated?",
        answer: "Yes. The system should distinguish urgency so teams can act quickly when a request needs immediate attention.",

      },
      {
        question: "Is this meant for one-off campaigns only?",
        answer: "No. The bigger value is consistent property marketing output without relying on a heavy production cycle every time.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can this support premium-looking property brands?",
